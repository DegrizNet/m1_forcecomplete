# OpenMage (Magento 1.9) - Mass Order Invoice/Ship

Do you have a lot of orders and not enough time? With just a few clicks, you can change the order statuses in bulk, add new orders for delivery, and create invoices. Time is money!

## Features
- **Save time in order processing**
- **Streamline the order processing workflow**
- **Increase your productivity**

The Magento module allows for easy bulk order status changes. With this module, there is no longer a need to open individual orders and manually confirm deliveries or complete orders. Instead, you can simply select all the orders you want to complete, saving you time and simplifying the order processing process.
